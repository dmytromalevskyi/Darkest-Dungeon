# Darkest-Dungeon
Oversimplified version of the game Darkest Dungeon that was written for my university course to learn about OOP and polymorphism. It is a turn base game where the player needs to explore the map and fight off enemies to get to the end of the dungeon. The game can be enjoyed on a terminal and in a GUI.

Features
-------------------------
* 3 different classes each with a unique ability
* Most classes have a unique passive ability
* Inventory with items that give permanent or time limited effect (4 items currently in the game)
* Saving the game and have a choice to carry on either in CLI or GUI


In development
-------------------------
* At least 2 more classes
* Map with scattered items all over it (progressively explored)
* More unique items

Command-line arguments
-------------------------
```text
-g	use graphical user interface
-l	use command line based interface
-s	restore or delete a local save of the game
```
